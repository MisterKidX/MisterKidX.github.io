# a summary about you
summary: 'My first real experience as a Game Designer was at the age of 5 when due to the warranted prohibition of the family’s computer I had to port my favorite game back then, Heroes of Might and Magic: A Strategic Quest, unto the floor tiles of our house (solid KPI’s btw).
Game Design is not only my profession, it is my hobby, my passion, and my mindset. I cast myself into any design, I direct others to match my vision and improve upon it, and I breathe the gameplay and the core values which make games truly interesting.'
