It‚Äôs an undertaking in which I show that quick prototyping is easy,fun, and can yield great results. I hope both you and I will learn a lot along the way.
Structure üõ†Ô∏è We will start by reverse-designing the game. We&amp;rsquo;ll understand what systems comprise gameplay and what needs to be done in terms of code, tech art, and assets.</description></item><item><title>Scriptable Holders</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/articles/unity/scriptableholders/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/articles/unity/scriptableholders/</guid><description>Preface Scriptable Objects (SOs) are awesome. It&amp;rsquo;s been said before, it will be said in the future and currently, many Unity devs use them to architect their code and write great games. But (you knew this was coming), they are still a tight coupling to the unity engine - Scriptable Objects only make sense inside the unity framework. I noticed most Unity devs don&amp;rsquo;t give a f*** about this, but I do give plenty.</description></item><item><title>GaW - Heroes of Might &amp; Magic</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/game-a-week/homm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/game-a-week/homm/</guid><description>Heroes of Might &amp;amp; Magic III is one of my all time favourite games.

Trying to imitate it in one week was both challenging and incredibly fun.

Overview Summoners Royale is truly a fascinating project. Resurrected from the dead (previously known as United Legends), Summoners Royale made deep impactful changes to its design to create a new gameplay expreince that could match the spirit of the company that produced it and to become a unique skill based game set against the agressive (and mostly disgusting) models of the web3 gaming.</description></item><item><title>Midbaryom</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/midbaryom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/midbaryom/</guid><description>Instead of cages, a 120 acre of savannah, teeming with life.
As a Game Designer you often than not - an entratainer. You craft expreiences that alleviate fun. That is why Midbaryom is a very special project, in size, purpose and ethical values.
A zoo is to be rebuilt as natural 120 acre savannanah, in the heart of the Israeli Negev. This Safari is not only meant to display the animals as some kind of trophies, but to actualy educate the people about the importance of wildelife perservance and to create empathy with the animals.</description></item><item><title>My First Animal</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/my-first-animal/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/my-first-animal/</guid><description> *A clean educational experience for toddlers about animals and the sound they make* Overview The game includes 7 scenes with 26 interactable animals and objects.

This flappy bird look-a-like is teaching us about the problems of current Parkinson medication and how they might be solved. The real pride of this project on my side, beyond the tight schedule, is the music and SFX that I composed üôÇ. The game was developed over a 24 hour preriod!

Remember Color Maze? You have to swipe your avatar around to fill the screen. Well, the level design on this game was even harder. The demand was to make the board smaller and the levels more visually appealing. This meant that the actual puzzle might be compromised. But in the end I used the same techniques to create challenging levels even on smaller scales.</description></item><item><title>Color Maze</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/colormaze/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/colormaze/</guid><description>Swipe! Swipe! Swipe to fill the screen with bright colors!
This project was challenging because of the overtly simple core mechanics, which at first didn‚Äôt allow intricate level design. In addition, the publishers didn‚Äôt want any levels where the player could actually get stuck, so a careful thought was given to how to build the levels that in the beginning they would introduce the mechanics and later on could actualy pose a bit of challenge.</description></item><item><title>VoX</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/exercises/vox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/exercises/vox/</guid><description>Race!
