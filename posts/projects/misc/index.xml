It‚Äôs an undertaking in which I show that quick prototyping is easy,fun, and can yield great results. I hope both you and I will learn a lot along the way.
Structure üõ†Ô∏è We will start by reverse-designing the game. We&amp;rsquo;ll understand what systems comprise gameplay and what needs to be done in terms of code, tech art, and assets.</description></item><item><title>GaW - Heroes of Might &amp; Magic</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/game-a-week/homm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/game-a-week/homm/</guid><description>Heroes of Might &amp;amp; Magic III is one of my all time favourite games. It proposes 4 core systesms (heroes, castles, exploration and combat) each feeding each other to create a hollistic and compelling gameplay. Trying to imitate it in one week was both challenging and incredibly fun.

In just 48 hours (- kids) we managed, me and my buddy Gilad, to create this beautiful, simple, fun game. What I love about this design is its simplicity and elegance. A Core mechanic, finding the opponents treasure with radars and nothing more.</description></item><item><title>VoX</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/exercises/vox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/exercises/vox/</guid><description>Race! VoX is a unique VR arcade game where you‚Äôll try to out best yourself and your friends. Collect coins, drift and stay on track!
If you worked with VR, guess you could spot the challenge here: How do you handle motion sickness and racing in VR? It‚Äôs hard, but doable. Wrapping google anti motion sickness SDK with unity scripts while also improving on that SDK proved to be a viable solution.</description></item></channel></rss>
