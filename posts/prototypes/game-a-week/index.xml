It proposes 4 core systesms (heroes, castles, exploration and combat) each feeding each other to create a hollistic and compelling gameplay. Trying to imitate it in one week was both challenging and incredibly fun.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Game in a Week (GaW) is a self-imposed challenge to build a bitching prototype for an existing game (preferably a genre-defining one).
It’s an undertaking in which I show that quick prototyping is easy,fun, and can yield great results. I hope both you and I will learn a lot along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="structure-">Structure 🛠️&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We will start by reverse-designing the game. We&amp;rsquo;ll understand what systems comprise gameplay and what needs to be done in terms of code, tech art, and assets.
We will also analyze the gameplay, defining interactions, events, and dynamics.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
