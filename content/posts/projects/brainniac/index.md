*Better! Faster! Smarter! Brainiac is a powerful tool for your mind and a pleasing one for your soul.*

Brainiac is all about improving your cognitive skills while having fun doing so. Featuring five different exercises, a solid progression system and a daily routine for players to utilize. As players advance and complete their daily goals, they encounter new difficulty elements in the same exercises, effectively keeping the game alive for longer and presenting the player with a true and natural progression curve.

My job was to design the whole game, whilst making sure to distribute tasks and assignments to the team.
