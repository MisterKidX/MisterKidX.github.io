*Race! VoX is a unique VR arcade game where youâ€™ll try to out best yourself and your friends. Collect coins, drift and stay on track!*

If you worked with VR, guess you could spot the challenge here: How do you handle motion sickness and racing in VR? Itâ€™s hard, but doable. Wrapping google anti motion sickness SDK with unity scripts while also improving on that SDK proved to be a viable solution. The game was also hosted on the Israeli Indie Playground Exhibition.

P.S. I did the coins, and iâ€™m so proud of them ðŸ™‚
