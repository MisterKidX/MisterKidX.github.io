## Overview

Phantom Beasts is a fast paced action game, set in a dystopian future where an evil corporation experiments on animals to distill the core essence of the scientific elements: time, space and matter. Our hero is Hunter, an ex soldier with a dark past looking for forgetfulness, but he will soon find our it is redemption he was looking for all along. During is ardous path he finds an enemy, soon to be friend, who saves his life, and also drives him mad.

## Role

As lead developer, I was in charge of two other developers while building the core systems for the game. "In Charge" is a bit misused here, as both developers were absolute professionals and terrific people. Most decisions were taken together and each had their own "island" to work on. I took on the challenge of building many of the core systems in the game: character controller, physics, collisions, shooting, weapons etc.

## Retrospect

Phantom Beasts development was hard lessons truly learned. At its core, the game had great potential, but we were naive about the production processes and did many mistakes in all aspects of development. The development of this game was part a test of passion and skill, both endured, but in the end feature creep, production ignorance, and lack of publishing skills brough it down. It's ok, everyone on the team loved what we did, and we wouldn't change a thing (obvious lie) for what we've learned.
