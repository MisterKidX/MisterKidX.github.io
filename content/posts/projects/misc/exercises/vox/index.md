## Overview

If you worked with VR, guess you could spot the challenge here: How do you handle motion sickness and racing in VR? Itâ€™s hard, but doable. Wrapping google anti motion sickness SDK with unity scripts while also improving on that SDK proved to be a viable solution. The game was also hosted on the Indie Playground Exhibition sposored by GameIS.

## Role

I worked on all aspects of the game, buy I mostly took the time to tackle motion sickness and creating game elements (such as the coins, which i'm so proud of ðŸ™‚). It was fun and quick to make. Game development, especially for VR, was simpler back then. New platofrms allow you to test new stuff, or rehash old stuff with a new set of inputs and player experience. I think that eventually the game was sold to a private buyer, an owner of a VR arcade.
