## Overview

Bow & Arrow is a fairly simple game. As I remember 2017, it was the dawn of VR games. Not that weren't made before, but mechanics and dynamics still haven't been fully explored. Many VR arcades looked for a cutting edge, propietry games that players could play only in that specific arcade. Bow & Arrow was one of those games.

## Role

As a sole developer I had to come up with every aspect of the game and make sure its tight enough to ship to a private buyer, given it'll have limited visibility. 3rd Party assets is truly a powerful concept when it comes to games, and aside from the game's systems and programming, all art and sound was either purchased or aquired for free (with proper licensing).
