## Overview

Brainiac is all about improving your cognitive skills while having fun doing so. Featuring five different exercises, a solid progression system and a daily routine for players to utilize. As players advance and complete their daily goals, they encounter new difficulty elements in the same exercises, effectively keeping the game alive for longer and presenting the player with a true and natural progression curve.

## Role

My job was to design the whole game, whilst making sure to distribute tasks and assignments to the team. I can't say working on this wasn't challenging. I found wearing the hat of both the producer and the designer challenging as I had internal conflicts on scope and design goals. Altogether it gave a much better understanding of team composition and managing relationships with programmers and middle management.

I wrote so much documentation for this game its insane XD
