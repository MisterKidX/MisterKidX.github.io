## Overview

"Warriors: Rise to Glory" (WRTG) was a blast to work on mainly because of the amazing people on the team and the great core game.

The game is humoristic and fun to play as it is to watch. Although I had my creative differences regarding the design (I still think strength is a shit attribute) I thought the game was on a good path. The entire backend services was supported by PlayFab, and I've worked there for most of my time.

## Role

Being sort of a fullstack was nice. One day I could be designing the Daily Quest systems and another I could play around with photon to implement a mechanic. Everywhere I went I tried to make the code a bit better, and working with PlayFab was streamlining many aspects of development. To surpass paid chat systems, I even built a custom chat!
