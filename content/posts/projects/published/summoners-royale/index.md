<center> <i> A Real time PvP strategy game for android (web3), empowering players with strategic decisions in lightweight tactical battles. </i> </center>

##### Overview
Summoners Royale is truly a fascinating project. Resurrected from the dead (previously known as [United Legends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf4vi8IQMIc&ab_channel=Nz0x)), Summoners Royale made deep impactful changes to its design to create a new gameplay expreince that could match the spirit of the company that produced it and to become a unique skill based game set against the agressive (and mostly disgusting) models of the web3 gaming. My Job as a Consulting Game Economist, was to help define how the economy will behave and how several unique audiences - Web2 player, web3 players and investors -  could participate in it fairly and have fun engaging with it.

##### Gameplay
In Summoners Royale, the players controls a number of summmoners that can invoke the aid of famous history characters such as David and Cleopatra. The player can construct his special lineup according to his playstyle and tactical needs. Summoners Royale has a small progression in the meta, but other than that it is completely skill depedant. No player can purchase his way to victory.

After constructing their unique lineup, player go and participate in epic battles against other players. With careful resource management, placing of troops, and selecting the right minions at the beggining of a match, a player could overcome any obstacle.
