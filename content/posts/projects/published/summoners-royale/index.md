## Overview

Summoners Royale was a truly interesting project. Resurrected from the dead (previously known as [United Legends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf4vi8IQMIc&ab_channel=Nz0x)), Summoners Royale made deep impactful changes to its design to create a new gameplay expreince that could match the spirit of the company that produced it and to become a unique skill based game set against the agressive (and mostly disgusting) models of the web3 gaming.

## Role

My Job as a Consulting Game Economist, was to help define how the economy will behave and how several unique audiences - Web2 player, web3 players and investors -  could participate in it fairly and have fun engaging with it. I tried really hard to create mechanics that would not allow players to buy themselves to victory, somthing that was keenly sought after during the cryptogaming surge. While having multiple ideas, the team eventually drifted towards a more monetized model and I declared my fealty to another project.
