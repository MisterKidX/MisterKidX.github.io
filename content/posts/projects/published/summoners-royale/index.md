##### Gameplay
In Summoners Royale, the players controls a number of summmoners that can invoke the aid of famous history characters such as David and Cleopatra. The player can construct his special lineup according to his playstyle and tactical needs. Summoners Royale has a small progression in the meta, but other than that it is completely skill depedant. No player can but his victory.

After constructing their unique lineup, player go and participate in epic battles against other players. With careful resource management, placing of troops, and selecting the right minions at the beggining of a match, a player could overcome any obstacle.
