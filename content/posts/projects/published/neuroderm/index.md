*Make your way through obstacles and learn a couple of things while at it!*

This flappy bird look-a-like is teaching us about the problems of current Parkinson medication and how they might be solved. The real pride of this project on my side, beyond the tight schedule, is the music and SFX that I composed ðŸ™‚. The game was developed over a 24 hour preriod!
