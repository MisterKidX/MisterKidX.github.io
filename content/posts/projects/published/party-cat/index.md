*Swipe your way around the house and clean it all up!*

Remember [Color Maze](/posts/projects/color-maze)? You have to swipe your avatar around to fill the screen. Well, the level design on this game was even harder. The demand was to make the board smaller and the levels more visually appealing. This meant that the actual puzzle might be compromised. But in the end I used the same techniques to create challenging levels even on smaller scales.
Took longer though ðŸ˜‰
