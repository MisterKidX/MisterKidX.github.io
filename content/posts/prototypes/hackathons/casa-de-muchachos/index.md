## Overview

In this global game jam I had to both produce and be an event organizer for the 12th biggest site in the world and create a game with the spare time I had. But, thanks to my amazing team, we made it just under **48** hrs. We created the spectacular Casa De Muchachos - a 4 player local coop game where you steal as much stuff from the bank before the time runs out. The quirky physics, the goofy avatars and the amazing music all collide into this laughable gameplay.

This year's theme was 'Masks', but we also had a local diversifier of 'CHAOS'. As you can see from the video, the game is extremely chaotic with its physics. The characters use animations, but their hands are masked and overriden with physics. This creates their unique appearance and goofy running animation. Really proud of what we could achieve in just 48 hours of work. Enjoy!
