## Overview

This is one of the first video games I ever made. It was part of a finnish hackathon I can't remember the name of. It was done by me, another developer, and one artist, all very unskilled. The theme of the hackathon was 'fire', and like all hackathons soon to be, we take theme quite seriously. To really bring out the theme through the mechanics, we decided that you would play a living candle trying to escape the sewers. As a candle, your life is represented by your height, meaning the longer you burn the closer to death you are. Moreover, light sources, like torches, also burn you. You can light yourself up to clear obstacles and light your way through darkness.

While on theory the game sounds cool, we were so young and naive that it isn't really a game. It doesn't conclude (no win \ lose), no FTUE, no QA... But I learned a lot. This is where I understood I love systems design - my creativity stems from systems less about themes.
