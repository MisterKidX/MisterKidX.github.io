## What is the "Game In A Week" Challenge? 🕹️
Game in a Week (GaW) is a self-imposed challenge to build a bitching prototype for an existing game (preferably a genre-defining one).
It’s an undertaking in which I show that quick prototyping is easy,fun, and can yield great results. I hope both you and I will learn a lot along the way. 

## Structure 🛠️
We will start by reverse-designing the game. We'll understand what systems comprise gameplay and what needs to be done in terms of code, tech art, and assets.
We will also analyze the gameplay, defining interactions, events, and dynamics.

We’ll then build the game from scratch while utilizing our design document to guide us.
This might start as a linear experience, but you'll see me diverge as we dive deeper into development, sometimes implementing a system "just enough" to move forward to others.
his is a creative process, and I try to use my motivation rather than bang my head against the wall. The main idea is to unfold the gameplay naturally, rather than working linearly. 

Finishing the game is subjective, so we'll tackle it in the predesign phase. 
We will decide together what "finishing" a game prototype means and define stretch goals. If we reach milestones early, we can add more features.
Overall, here’s what we’re talking about:
- 🕒 3-5 hours of preliminary design
- ⚙️ 50-60 hours of iteration
- 🔧 60% hours on systems programming
- 🎮 20% hours on gameplay programming and design (creating content and balancing)
- 💥 20% hours on game feel
- 🚀 3 hours on publishing

Failure is an option. You might see me fail to meet set goals in the design phase. That’s okay – that's real life and real game development.
If I fail to reach the bare minimum milestone, I'll give myself an extra 10 hours to save my already stained honor. 

## Clarifications 📝
While GaW assumes 56 hours, the work itself is not bound to a single calendar week. 
I'm a family man with a 'steady' job in the game industry. This means work will be within set hours but might extend over more days. I'll try to keep it under two weeks.

Code quality will be shit 💩, and that’s okay. We're not here for perfect, scalable code; we’re making a quick prototype.
That being said, you’ll still see me tackling architectural problems and finding decent solutions.

All materials and source code will be shared with you, the audience unless prohibited (like with paid assets).
