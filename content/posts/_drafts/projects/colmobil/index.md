##### Scope
3 overdemanding weeks

##### Overview
Like a lot of my freenlace work, the Colmobil Car Show was unique mostly due to its time constraint - I had 3 weeks to prepare 3 apps, one of them is the simulated car environemnt. The other two apps, which were smaller scale, were given to a subcontractor (now a friend), the mighty Kobi Malul. The 3 weeks were to end with me installing the app on premise, but the true effort was managing client demands. In case of a project like this, I always prepare a technical document listing everything the client will get, including the formats of the build and what not. I always leave room for client additions, because I like to give the extra stuff they need, but this project really tested me on that issue, and it's the first time I learned to say NO. Moreover, my 3rd child was born during the project, which added more pressure. To my wifes demise, I brought my laptop to the hospital, 3 days before the delivery (of the baby). Honestly that woman deserves a medal for staying with me.

I am more cautious these days, but I still believe every quote should include some space for the client to change his mind.

##### Overview
Summoners Royale is truly a fascinating project. Resurrected from the dead (previously known as [United Legends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf4vi8IQMIc&ab_channel=Nz0x)), Summoners Royale made deep impactful changes to its design to create a new gameplay expreince that could match the spirit of the company that produces it and to become a unique skill based game set against the agressive models of the web3 gaming. My Job as a Game Economist, what to help define how the economy will behave and how several unique audiences - Web2 player, web3 players, investors -  could participate in it fairly and have fun engaging with it.

##### Gameplay
In Summoners Royale, the players controls a number of summmoners that can invoke the aid of famous history characters such as David and Cleopatra. The player can construct his special lineup according to his playstyle and tactical needs. Summoners Royale has a small progression in the meta, but other than that it is completely skill depedant. No player can but his victory.

After constructing their unique lineup, player go and participate in epic battles against other players. With careful resource management, placing of troops, and selecting the right minions at the beggining of a match, a player could overcome any obstacle.
