How do you define a medium that shapeshifts depending on the participants point of reference? It is a dissonance, that games are impossible to define, but are so easily defined in our minds. Humans certainly understand when they do and when they aren't, playing games.

Defining games is somewhat of a futile persuement. I don't think one defintion can encompass this huge and complex medium. but, the strive for a solution and the road taken to find answers, is more important than the goal. In these strange times of "Earn to Play", china gamifying her civ system, and digitized gambling ruling the gaming worls, we must ask difficult questions and challenge the way we think about games and what defines them.

In hebrew, the word for game and play are the same. in essence you would say "to game a game" as you would say in english "to play a game". That is intriguing. It is known that old shemic languages have less words, and sometimes less means more. Hebrew suggests that when we pick on an acitivity and start playing it, we also start formulating a construct around that play. Our minds automatically takes us from this shapeless form of play into a constructed form of play - a game. If you interject a child's play you would often be surprised that they engage their activity with a structured mindset. It would seem chaotic at first, but then you can move a piece of furniture or toy and face the consequences of ruining their game. That piece you just moved and an endogeouns meaning to the play acitivity, it was important to them and to the fictional construct they built around it.

Remember! A toy is something you play With, a game is something you play within.

- take these two examples, which of them are games
  - "the player must use the ball the bounce it against the wall, each time he succeeds to bounce it and catch it without the ball touching the floor he gains one point."
  - "the player must use the ball the bounce it against the wall, each time he succeeds to bounce it and catch it without the ball touching the floor he gains one point. *The objective is to get as much points as possible*."

Are both of these descriptions define games? Think about it carefully. If you'd ask me couple years back I would say yes, because the first definition incurs a quantifiable outcome, one of the core values I used to define games with. BUT, the game does not strictly pose an objective, and therefore, it is not a game (what is it btw), its extremely close to being one though. Why is it though that if I give you a ball and that description, you would consider yourself playing a game? because informal objectives are as much as important as formal ones, if not more. Whe a player picks the first description and starts playing, she will automatically construct an objective for herself, she often doesn't need the game to tell her exactly what to do. It is not wholly a toy either, because it does enforce arbitrary rules. 

so what is the first description depicting in terms of definitions? It is not only a toy and not entirely a game. It is a simulation. A simulation has everything a game has, but it lacks the objectives (btw, a realistic simulation is a simulation which rules are not arbitrary). So in order to call ourselves game makers must we introduce formal objectives. Absofuckinglutely not. The design space of creating a product that does not have formal objectives is more finnessed than to create formal objective games. In some sense you will need to exert more skill to anticipate the players' informal objectives of your simulation, and design accordingly. Eventually, you are a game designer because people will pick up your product and play it as games because they can easily find their own goals.

This is exremely apperant in a game like The Sims. Formally speaking, the sims is not a game. It has no formal objectives. but the designers sprinkle so much implicit outcomes it is hard to play it and not consider it as such. By the way, some players can't stand the Sims for exactly that reason, it lacks the formal objectives they need (usualy apperant on achievers type of players). Not accidently these games were termed Sim(ulation)City The Sim(ulation)S, SimEarth, SimAnt etc. Will Wright is a fucking genious.

Unlike most mediums which must have some attributes to them (literature - written words, film - video, etc.) games can emerge anywhere and at any time. There are infinite games just waiting to be found.

# Assumptions

Games are interactive - they require a consumer to take an active part.

Games must have a structure.

Games are driven by meaningful interaction.


# The ball allegory

*Is a ball thrown by a robot against a wall considered a game? What if a human throws the ball?* - only humans can play games

*I now have the ball in my possession. I throw it against the wall, I squish it, I bounce it on my feet; I do much with that ball. In any of these scenarios, did I play a game?* - no, it is a toy

*I now impose structure on my play activity by introducing a new rule: I can only use my right hand. Am I playing a game?* - no, the rule must be related to the objective - is this a puzzle?

*I now take the ball and throw it against the wall, but this time I start taking count on each hit on the wall. When the ball drops to the ground I reset the counter. Am I playing a game now?* - no formal objective, just quatifiable outcome. But, players will understand immediatly that a falling ball means losing and a catched ball means better score. This is not a game, this is a simulation.

*Someone watched me playing with the ball, he asks me what are the rules. I explain everything to him but add: “your goal is to bounce the ball without it falling to the ground” Did I describe a game?* - yes

# Differences

I'd have you remember that design is not about dichotomous definitions, it is a range between two extremes, raraely does any definition or value reach that extreme. In that case, simulations are games, but their rules are not arbitrary (they try to mimick the real world), their objective is somewhat vague unless you're playing a specific "mission".

on that note edu-games have an exogenous value, their objective is to teach the player things about the outside world, rather than teach players about the inside (good edu-games do both obviously)

puzzles have a formal objective of "solve this", and once solved, they are less appealing (I would argue many single player games, when done, are somewhat solved).

## difference between games and toys

Games and toys are not commutative, since all games are toys but not all toys are games.

A toy or any other play activity (an activity that demands interaction) can be rendered into a game only with an imposed structure. Effectually, every game must have at least one rule.

Games have goals that can be strictly measured.



## difference between games and simulations

## difference between games and educational 'games'

## difference between games and puzzles

a puzzle is an activity in which the participant must find a way to do something. As in, find a way to put every piece together to complete the picture. Find a way to throw the ball only with your right hand (a sucky puzzle, but a puzzle nonetheless).


# exploring the definition

"An imposed fictional construct, defined by arbitrary rules, driven by meaningful interaction and measured in formal outcomes."

Let's start from the end.

## formal outcomes

I'll make a piece about objective taxonomy, but formal outcomes means that the game must impose rules on how it is concluded, in the familiar form of Win \ Lose.

A game must have an objective. But that objective can be formal like “you win \ you lose” or informal in the player’s head “I must do this level on the least time possible.”. Does that exclude products like The Sims which don’t have a defined goal? Yes, and no. The Sims is not a game, per se, it is a software toy, a simulation, which lays a lot of quantifiable outcomes so that players (or users) will find their informal objective within the structure (best career, family, money, social connections, etc.).

It is important to note that informal objectives are formal objectives for the player. They might even be much stronger than what the game suggests.

Formal objectives must have a 

## meaningful interaction

Now more than ever decisions draw the line between games and interactive experiences, which share so much in terms of their essence, but are vastly different from one another. A game must have decisions, but further than that, it must have meaningful decisions.

that's an interesting one, originally I had written down "meainngful decisions" but later changed that to interactions.

# challenges

let's challenge ourselves with multiple games and see what we think of wether they fall within our defintion.

- The Saw: remember that gruesome movie and the all out catch phrase "Let's play a game"?
- professional players: whether in sports or e-sports, professional players are paid to play their game, does that mean its no longer a game to them but their job? can it be both or is mutually exclusive?
- slot machines: are slot machines games? if not, why are they considered so by their users?
- is roullette a game? is gambling in general a game? Roulette is a simulation, the game is the betting part.
- hyper casual: do the games that have only meaningless interactions, such as shoots and ladders, are they games?


# definition from the other end

We defined what games are as a product, but as stated before, for someone to "play a game" he needs to enter the fictional structure. This is dependant on two things. first, if the simulation has no formal objective than the player must make an informal objective. Second, the player must find endogonous meaning in the game, and not think only what he can get from it outside of the game structure. This is closely related to how professional players can think when entering a game. If they all they have on their mind is the external objective of making money, than they wouldn't be playing a game, they would be just working.

One of the reasons it's so hard to define games is the subjective (intuitive nature) of humans. If a human doesn’t feel he is playing a game, then he is not. If he does feel so, then he is. That is why it is so intuitive to answer “am I playing a game right now” rather than defining a game product.

# Other defintions

“A structured form of Play” - wikipedia
One of the best definitions of a game, simple, elegant, short and leave a lot of room for mistakes

“A game has “ends and means”: an objective, an outcome, and a set of rules to get there” - Bernard Suits

"A game is a series of interesting decisions" - Sid Meier
This is why it is improtant that any designer will have its own defintion of what a game is, since it is the design pillar by which all of your games will get their value. Obviously Sid doesn't believe that games on an academic level are a serious of interesting decisions, but it is what he likes in games and what he wants to express when designing games.

“A play activity with rules that involves conflict.” - Ian Schreiber
Conflict is friction, it is one body trying to move in a way that is conflicting with physical rules of the world.
To use the terminology of games, it is an entity trying to achieve something and the structure imposing a challenge: other entities, the structure itself, the precision of the entity and more.



# must games be fun?

Jobs are inherently a construct with governing rules. We can easily spot do’s and don’ts. So why aren’t jobs games in the first place?
Because jobs are nested in reality, with real consequences, whereas games are nested in fiction. To “enter” a game, we must choose to do so awarely, and that is what makes games a subjective experience.

Fun - Games are not about fun, per se, they are a medium that conveys an experience through the means of interaction. Games hold inherent values of fun, enjoyment, or entertainment because they convey consequences in a safe environment.
