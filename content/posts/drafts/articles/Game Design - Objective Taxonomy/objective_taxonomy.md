Objectives will always be the core pillars of what makes a game. Remember, simply playing with something does not mean you're playing a game

Objectives can be categorized by their relation to the MDA aspects: mechanics, dynamics, aesthetics.
- mechanics: formal objectives
- dynamics: goals
- aesthetics: informal objectives
