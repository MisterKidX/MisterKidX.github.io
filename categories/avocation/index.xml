It‚Äôs an undertaking in which I show that quick prototyping is easy,fun, and can yield great results. I hope both you and I will learn a lot along the way.
Structure üõ†Ô∏è We will start by reverse-designing the game. We&amp;rsquo;ll understand what systems comprise gameplay and what needs to be done in terms of code, tech art, and assets.</description></item><item><title>GaW - Heroes of Might &amp; Magic</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/game-a-week/homm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/game-a-week/homm/</guid><description>Heroes of Might &amp;amp; Magic III is one of my all time favourite games. It proposes 4 core systesms (heroes, castles, exploration and combat) each feeding each other to create a hollistic and compelling gameplay. Trying to imitate it in one week was both challenging and incredibly fun.
