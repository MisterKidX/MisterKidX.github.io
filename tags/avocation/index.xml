It‚Äôs an undertaking in which I show that quick prototyping is easy,fun, and can yield great results. I hope both you and I will learn a lot along the way.
Structure üõ†Ô∏è We will start by reverse-designing the game. We&amp;rsquo;ll understand what systems comprise gameplay and what needs to be done in terms of code, tech art, and assets.</description></item><item><title>Treasure Hunt</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/hackathons/treasure-hunt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/hackathons/treasure-hunt/</guid><description>*1v1 multiplayer game in which each player hides his treasure, and tries to find his opponents.* Overview It was SO-MUCH-FUN making this game (excuse the all-caps but I really mean it) in the 2021 Global Game Jam. In just 48 hours (- kids) we managed, me and my buddy Gilad, to create this beautiful, simple, fun game. What I love about this design is its simplicity and elegance. A Core mechanic, finding the opponents treasure with radars and nothing more.</description></item></channel></rss>
