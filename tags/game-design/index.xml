Overview Summoners Royale is truly a fascinating project. Resurrected from the dead (previously known as United Legends), Summoners Royale made deep impactful changes to its design to create a new gameplay expreince that could match the spirit of the company that produces it and to become a unique skill based game set against the agressive models of the web3 gaming.</description></item><item><title>Midbaryom</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/midbaryom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/midbaryom/</guid><description>Instead of cages, a 120 acre of savannah, teeming with life.
As a Game Designer you often than not - an entratainer. You craft expreiences that alleviate fun. That is why Midbaryom is a very special project, in size, purpose and ethical values.
A zoo is to be rebuilt as natural 120 acre savannanah, in the heart of the Israeli Negev. This Safari is not only meant to display the animals as some kind of trophies, but to actualy educate the people about the importance of wildelife perservance and to create empathy with the animals.</description></item><item><title>My First Animal</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/my-first-animal/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/my-first-animal/</guid><description> *A clean educational experience for toddlers about animals and the sound they make* Overview The game includes 7 scenes with 26 interactable animals and objects. The game&amp;rsquo;s input is intuitive and designed specifically for toddlers - only swipe left or right. No cumbersome UI that children can missclick.

In just 48 hours (- kids) we managed, me and my buddy Gilad, to create this beautiful, simple, fun game. What I love about this design is its simplicity and elegance. A Core mechanic, finding the opponents treasure with radars and nothing more.</description></item><item><title>Brainiac</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/brainiac/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/brainiac/</guid><description>Better! Faster! Smarter! Brainiac is a powerful tool for your mind and a pleasing one for your soul.
Brainiac is all about improving your cognitive skills while having fun doing so. Featuring five different exercises, a solid progression system and a daily routine for players to utilize. As players advance and complete their daily goals, they encounter new difficulty elements in the same exercises, effectively keeping the game alive for longer and presenting the player with a true and natural progression curve.</description></item><item><title>Party Cat</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/party-cat/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/party-cat/</guid><description>Swipe your way around the house and clean it all up!
Remember Color Maze? You have to swipe your avatar around to fill the screen. Well, the level design on this game was even harder. The demand was to make the board smaller and the levels more visually appealing. This meant that the actual puzzle might be compromised. But in the end I used the same techniques to create challenging levels even on smaller scales.</description></item><item><title>Color Maze</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/colormaze/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/colormaze/</guid><description>Swipe! Swipe! Swipe to fill the screen with bright colors!
This project was challenging because of the overtly simple core mechanics, which at first didn’t allow intricate level design. In addition, the publishers didn’t want any levels where the player could actually get stuck, so a careful thought was given to how to build the levels that in the beginning they would introduce the mechanics and later on could actualy pose a bit of challenge.</description></item><item><title>VoX</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/exercises/vox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/exercises/vox/</guid><description>Race! VoX is a unique VR arcade game where you’ll try to out best yourself and your friends. Collect coins, drift and stay on track!
If you worked with VR, guess you could spot the challenge here: How do you handle motion sickness and racing in VR? It’s hard, but doable. Wrapping google anti motion sickness SDK with unity scripts while also improving on that SDK proved to be a viable solution.</description></item><item><title>Bow &amp; Arrow</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/bow-and-arrow/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/bow-and-arrow/</guid><description>“Hear ye! Hear ye! The king is looking for the best archer in the land! Are you up for a challenge of Bow &amp;amp; Arrow?
This was so much fun to make and one of my first experiences with VR. The game feels intuitive to play and player skill increases in a steep curve.
