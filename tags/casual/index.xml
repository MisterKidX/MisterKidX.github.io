This flappy bird look-a-like is teaching us about the problems of current Parkinson medication and how they might be solved. The real pride of this project on my side, beyond the tight schedule, is the music and SFX that I composed 🙂. The game was developed over a 24 hour preriod!

It required a lot of research on the new platform and a deep dive into social mechanics and communication features. You can take a look at the early design process here (the first edit of the doc).</description></item></channel></rss>
