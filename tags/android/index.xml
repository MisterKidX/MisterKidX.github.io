In addition, the publishers didn’t want any levels where the player could actually get stuck, so a careful thought was given to how to build the levels that in the beginning they would introduce the mechanics and later on could actualy pose a bit of challenge.
The next game in the series, Party Cat, posed even a greater challenge as the game board shrank and the demand for more visually stimulating levels was introduced.</description></item></channel></rss>
