It&amp;rsquo;s been said before, it will be said in the future and currently, many Unity devs use them to architect their code and write great games. But (you knew this was coming), they are still a tight coupling to the unity engine - Scriptable Objects only make sense inside the unity framework. I noticed most Unity devs don&amp;rsquo;t give a f*** about this, but I do give plenty.</description></item><item><title>GaW - Heroes of Might &amp; Magic</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/game-a-week/homm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/game-a-week/homm/</guid><description>Heroes of Might &amp;amp; Magic III is one of my all time favourite games. It proposes 4 core systesms (heroes, castles, exploration and combat) each feeding each other to create a hollistic and compelling gameplay. Trying to imitate it in one week was both challenging and incredibly fun.

Overview Summoners Royale is truly a fascinating project. Resurrected from the dead (previously known as United Legends), Summoners Royale made deep impactful changes to its design to create a new gameplay expreince that could match the spirit of the company that produced it and to become a unique skill based game set against the agressive (and mostly disgusting) models of the web3 gaming.</description></item><item><title>Treasure Hunt</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/hackathons/treasure-hunt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/misc/hackathons/treasure-hunt/</guid><description>*1v1 multiplayer game in which each player hides his treasure, and tries to find his opponents.* Overview It was SO-MUCH-FUN making this game (excuse the all-caps but I really mean it) in the 2021 Global Game Jam. In just 48 hours (- kids) we managed, me and my buddy Gilad, to create this beautiful, simple, fun game. What I love about this design is its simplicity and elegance. A Core mechanic, finding the opponents treasure with radars and nothing more.</description></item><item><title>Neuroderm</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/neuroderm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/neuroderm/</guid><description>Make your way through obstacles and learn a couple of things while at it!
This flappy bird look-a-like is teaching us about the problems of current Parkinson medication and how they might be solved. The real pride of this project on my side, beyond the tight schedule, is the music and SFX that I composed ðŸ™‚. The game was developed over a 24 hour preriod!

VoX is a unique VR arcade game where youâ€™ll try to out best yourself and your friends. Collect coins, drift and stay on track!
If you worked with VR, guess you could spot the challenge here: How do you handle motion sickness and racing in VR? Itâ€™s hard, but doable. Wrapping google anti motion sickness SDK with unity scripts while also improving on that SDK proved to be a viable solution.</description></item><item><title>Bow &amp; Arrow</title><link>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/bow-and-arrow/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.dorbendor.com/posts/projects/published/bow-and-arrow/</guid><description>â€œHear ye! Hear ye! The king is looking for the best archer in the land! Are you up for a challenge of Bow &amp;amp; Arrow?
This was so much fun to make and one of my first experiences with VR. The game feels intuitive to play and player skill increases in a steep curve.
