My personal website

## Quick Start

### Running the site locally
At the root of the repo, you have a batch file containing a simple command to run the site locally. To do so, you would have to:
1. have Hugo [installed]([url](https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/#prebuilt-binaries)https://gohugo.io/installation/windows/#prebuilt-binaries)
2. and add an environment variable (PATH) leading to hugo.exe.
3. add the environment variable MySite to Path - making it lead to the root of the repo.
Then, any changes made locally can be mocked by running the runSite batch file. Run this as an administrator just in case.
